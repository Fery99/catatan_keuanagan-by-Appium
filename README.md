I will demonstrate how to use a financial recording application. However, I will demonstrate it using Appium (for Automation Testing) to run this demo. The main test cases include adding income and expense records, deleting records, and displaying overall analysis.


"Catatan Keuangan" is a simple app that helps users record their financial activities, including expenses and income.
